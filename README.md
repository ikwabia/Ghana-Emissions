# Ghana-Emissions
The Ghana Emissions Repository is a comprehensive analysis that cover valuable insights into the trends and correlations of  emissions in Ghana from 2000 to 2022, highlighting the country’s air pollution
# Ghana’s Natural Wealth and Emissions:
Rich in natural resources, precious minerals, and renowned for cocoa production.
Development and quality of life improvements come at the cost of environmental health.
## Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emissions:
Predominant emission throughout the study period.
Declined from 2000 to 2018, with a notable increase from 2009.
Rapid rise from 2016 to 2022 due to deforestation, industrialization, and mining practices.
Energy and transportation sectors are significant contributors.
## Ammonia (NH₃) and NMVOC Emissions:
Ranked second in emission levels.
Influenced by agricultural practices and waste management challenges.
Population growth and urbanization have exacerbated landfill emissions
## Nitrous Oxide (NOx) Emissions:
Third highest, subtly increasing due to illegal mining and water pollution.
The use of inorganic fertilizers in agriculture is also a contributing factor.
## Emission Trends Over the Years:
2000-2008: Downward trend until 2005, followed by an increase, with 2008 being the lowest.
2009-2022: Yearly increase in total emissions, with 2022 recording the highest.
## Sustainable Development and Policy Implications:
The challenge lies in achieving development without leaving a heavy emission footprint.
Solutions may include reforestation, improved waste management, and affordable solar energy policies.
