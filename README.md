# Ghana Emissions
The Ghana Emissions Repository is a comprehensive analysis that cover valuable insights into the trends and correlations of  emissions in Ghana from 2000 to 2022, highlighting the country’s air pollution
# Ghana’s Natural Wealth and Emissions:
Rich in natural resources, precious minerals, and renowned for cocoa production.
Development and quality of life improvements come at the cost of environmental health.
## Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emissions:
Predominant emission throughout the study period.
Declined from 2000 to 2018, with a notable increase from 2009.
Rapid rise from 2016 to 2022 due to deforestation, industrialization, and mining practices.
Energy and transportation sectors are significant contributors.
## Ammonia (NH₃) and NMVOC Emissions:
Ranked second in emission levels.
Influenced by agricultural practices and waste management challenges.
Population growth and urbanization have exacerbated landfill emissions
## Nitrous Oxide (NOx) Emissions:
Third highest, subtly increasing due to illegal mining and water pollution.
The use of inorganic fertilizers in agriculture is also a contributing factor.
## Emission Trends Over the Years:
2000-2008: Downward trend until 2005, followed by an increase, with 2008 being the lowest.
2009-2022: Yearly increase in total emissions, with 2022 recording the highest.
## The heatmap  
It indicates a strong positive correlation between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC),
highlighting that sources contributing to NO2 are likely to increase NMVOC emissions as well. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions have almost no correlation with ammonia (NH3), suggesting independent sources. 
This data is essential for developing targeted environmental policies that address the specific sources and interactions of these pollutants.
## Sustainable Development and Policy Implications:
The challenge lies in achieving development without leaving a heavy emission footprint.
Solutions may include reforestation, improved waste management, and affordable solar energy policies.
